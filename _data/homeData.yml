  I am a fifth year economics PhD student at the Norwegian School of Economics NHH and affiliated with FAIR - Centre for Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality and BIP Lab - Behavioral Insights and Parenting Lab.

  My primary research field is behavioral economics and I use lab-in-the-field and online experiments to study questions in the economics of education.

  My research agenda is centered around understanding how informational and behavioral barriers affect the decision-making of parents and children.

  In 2023/2024, I visited the University of Chicago hosted by Ariel Kalil at the Harris School of Public Policy. I hold both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Economics from the University of Mannheim.

  - title: "Parental Belief Updating About Children’s Abilities: Experimental Evidence from Norway (Job Market Paper)"
    abstract: |
      This study examines whether parents update beliefs about their children’s abilities in systematically biased ways. In a lab-in-the-field experiment in Norway, parents received noisy but unbiased signals about their seventh-grade child’s performance in mathematics or prosociality (measured via incentivized dictator games). I test how updating varies by signal valence, domain, and ego-relevance. Parents generally overestimate their child’s abilities and deviate from Bayesian updating. Asymmetric updating appears only in prosociality, where positive, ego-relevant signals receive more weight, especially under intergenerational framing. In mathematics, updating is symmetric and less affected by framing. Negative prosocial signals lead parents to downplay effort but raise educational aspirations and investment intentions. The findings provide novel evidence of belief updating about others’ performance, specifically in the parent–child context.

  - title: "Does Parental Feedback Shape Children’s (Over)Confidence?"
    abstract: |
      This paper studies how parents shape the ego-relevant information children receive about themselves and how it influences the beliefs and behavior of children. Using a field experiment with 7th-grade Norwegian students and their parents, we show that parents provide their children with feedback that is systematically more favorable than parents' private beliefs. Children incorporate this positively biased feedback into their self-assessments. The gap between parents' private beliefs and communicated feedback is larger when feedback precedes task completion, suggesting motivational intent. The study contributes to the understanding of how social transmission of self-relevant information, rather than just individual cognitive biases, shapes overconfidence.

  - title: Parents’ Perceptions of Children’s Economic Prospects Affect Parental Investments"
    abstract: |
      Individuals are sensitive to cues about economic conditions in ways that affect their beliefs and behavior. This paper experimentally tests how parents’ perceptions of children’s mobility prospects affect parental investments of time and money in child skill development. An experiment involving approximately 1,000 parents of children aged 5–17 aimed to shift parents’ beliefs regarding the possibility of future upward (downward) economic mobility in US society. We find that parents are responsive to signals about their children’s future economic mobility prospects. Using a novel measure of time investment, parents who are prompted to consider favorable prospects for their children increase their time investments to enhance their children’s skills and report being more willing to pay for resources to achieve this aim. These parents also strengthen their beliefs about the returns on parental investments, highlighting a plausible mechanism. Effects on beliefs and behavior are consistent across parents of varying income and educational levels.
