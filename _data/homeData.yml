    I am a fifth year economics PhD student at the Norwegian School of Economics NHH and affiliated with FAIR - Centre for Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality and BIP Lab - Behavioral Insights and Parenting Lab.

    My primary research field is behavioral economics and I use lab-in-the-field and online experiments to study questions in the economics of education.

    My research agenda is centered around understanding how informational and behavioral barriers affect the decision-making of parents and children.

    In 2023/2024, I visited the University of Chicago hosted by Ariel Kalil at the Harris School of Public Policy. I hold both a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in Economics from the University of Mannheim.
